# I'm Bored - Activity Suggestion App

This is a simple Node.js app built with Express that helps users find random activities to do when they are bored.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to **learn how to use APIs** in a Node.js environment, specifically focusing on making HTTP requests with **Axios**. It demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API and render it dynamically in a web page using EJS templates.

## Features

- Displays a random activity on the homepage by fetching from the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/).
- Allows filtering activities based on:
  - Type of activity (e.g., education, charity, recreational, etc.)
  - Number of participants
- Displays activity details including the name, type, and number of participants.
- Handles errors gracefully when no activities match the filter criteria or when the API request fails.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios (for API calls)
- EJS 
- Basic CSS for styling 

## Learning Points

- How to perform GET requests with Axios in a Node.js backend.
- Handling asynchronous requests with async/await.
- Rendering dynamic data using EJS templates.
- Processing form input and sending API requests based on user input.
- Basic error handling for API calls.
